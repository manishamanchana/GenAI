## 🛠️ Steps

1. **Start with Python** — Comfortable with Python basics, as it’s essential for all LLM-related work.
2. **Understand LLM Fundamentals** — Learn how LLMs work, key architectures like Transformers, and techniques like LoRA/qLoRA.
3. **Explore Tools and Frameworks** — Gain experience with LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and prompt engineering.
4. **Take Online Courses** — Follow the linked resources to solidify your understanding and skills.
